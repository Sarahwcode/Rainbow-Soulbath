              >"I am a seasoned alternative sound therapist with over 20 years
              of experience. I have honed my craft in Bali, I am passionate
              about using sound to facilitate deep relaxation, stress reduction,
              and spiritual awakening. <br />Beyond my therapeutic work, I am a
              believer in the power of movement and manifestation. I enjoy
              dancing, believing that it can be a potent tool for aligning with
              one's intentions. <br />
              Additionally, I am certified cacao facilitator, specializing in
              the five-element cacao dance, a transformative experience that
              combines the sacred plant medicine with movement and intention
              setting. My commitment to holistic well-being extends beyond sound
              therapy. I enjoy yoga exploring other activities that promote
              mental peace and clarity. <br />
              My extensive travels, including a year-long residency in Thailand,
              have enriched her understanding of diverse cultures and healing
              modalities. Drawing upon my 15 years of experience with Native
              American ceremonies and plant medicines, I incorporate elements of
              these traditions into my sessions, including sacred singing.
              <br /><strong>
                My approach is grounded in respect for ancient wisdom and a deep
                connection to nature. To learn more about my services and how I
                can help you on your journey to well-being, please explore the
                sessions she offers below."</strong
