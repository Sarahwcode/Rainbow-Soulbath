However, through the unique way I deliver my sessions, I've observed that they go deeper than just rejuvenation. I open doors for you to have your own experience. My sessions guide you into a present, open-hearted space where you feel safe to explore your inner world. This environment encourages authentic self-expression and a deeper connection to your true self, without fear of judgment. In this way, I create a supportive space where profound healing and personal growth can unfold."</em

       <em> "Sound Bath Healing with Carina - A Transformative Experience
        I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a sound bath healing session with Carina, 
        and I can honestly say it has been one of the most powerful moments in my lifes’s journey. 
        Initially, I felt a bit apprehensive, unsure of what to expect, but Carina’s warm and calming presence 
        immediately put me at ease."</em> 
      </div>
      <div class="testimonial-item">
        <em> 
          "From the very beginning, the session felt deeply nurturing. 
          The sound vibrations seemed to resonate with every part of me—mind, body, and spirit. 
          I can truly say I felt a shift within my very being. This wasn’t just relaxation; it was realignment, clarity, and release."</em>

       </div>

      
<div class="testimonial-item"><em>
"Over the days that followed, it felt as though something deep within me had been awakened. 
It was an awakening of the soul—a deep remembering of who I am beyond the noise of daily life. 
I’ve felt like I’ve been peeling back the layers of an onion, gently releasing old patterns and healing wounds I didn’t 
even realise I was still carrying."</em></div>
<div class="testimonial-item"><em>
"Each layer revealed more of my truth, my light, and ultimately, a clearer sense of my soul’s purpose and journey."</em></div>
<div class="testimonial-item"><em>
"The best part of this experience is how the bowls awakened the inner child in me—reminding me of who
 I truly am, and reconnecting me to the playful, joyful spirit I carry within. The vibrations of the bowls felt 
 like someone was gently whispering in my ear, tickling my senses, and reminding me of the feeling of laughing freely as a child. 
 It brought me back to a place of innocence, wonder, and lightness."</em></div>
 <div class="testimonial-item text-center"><em>
"I’m not just okay—I feel whole, joyful, and incredibly blessed. ✨"</em></div>
<div class="testimonial-item"><em>
"Carina holds a truly sacred space for this kind of work. Her intuition, care, and energy made me feel safe, seen, 
and completely open to receiving whatever I needed in that moment."</em></div>
<div class="testimonial-item"><em>
"The experience has enlightened me on so many levels, and I’m still feeling the ripples of transformation days later.
 It’s hard to describe how powerful it was—it was simply unbelievable."</em></div>
 <div class="testimonial-item"><em>
"I am deeply grateful for Carina and her gift. If you are on a healing path, curious about sound therapy, 
or simply seeking a deeper connection with yourself, I cannot recommend her enough. This is not just healing—it’s 
remembering who you truly are."" </em></div>
